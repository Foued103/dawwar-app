# Fixes Applied

## Error: `java.lang.String cannot be cast to java.lang.Boolean`

### Problem
This error occurs when running the app on Android with the expo-camera plugin. It's caused by the `newArchEnabled: true` flag in `app.json` conflicting with expo-camera on certain Expo versions.

### Solution Applied
Removed `newArchEnabled: true` from `app.json` (line 9).

```json
// Before
{
  "userInterfaceStyle": "light",
  "newArchEnabled": true,
  "splash": { ... }
}

// After
{
  "userInterfaceStyle": "light",
  "splash": { ... }
}
```

## Design Improvements Based on Inspiration

### 1. Added Home Screen
- Created `HomeScreen.tsx` with services, materials, and nearby stations
- Added green header with user info and location
- Implemented search bar with QR code button
- Added service cards matching the inspiration design

### 2. Elevated Center Tab Button
- Scanner tab now has an elevated circular button
- Matches the inspiration design with white border and shadow
- Center button is larger and more prominent

### 3. Scan Result Modal
- Created `ScanResultModal.tsx` component
- Shows scan results in a bottom sheet modal
- Displays material type, COâ‚‚ saved, and reward points
- "Add Recycle Bag" button ready for cart functionality

### 4. Updated Navigation
- Changed from 3 tabs to 4 tabs (Home, Scanner, Marketplace, Profile)
- Scanner tab has special elevated styling
- Better matches the inspiration UI/UX

## Testing the Fixes

1. **Clean the project**:
   ```bash
   cd /home/foued/Developement/dawwar
   rm -rf node_modules
   npm install
   npx expo start --clear
   ```

2. **Test on device**:
   - Open Expo Go app
   - Scan the QR code
   - Camera should work without the casting error

3. **Test the new features**:
   - Home tab shows the dashboard
   - Scanner tab has elevated center button
   - Scanning shows the result modal
   - All tabs navigate smoothly

## Additional Notes

- The Node.js version warning (18.20.8 vs 20.19.4) is not critical but you may want to upgrade Node.js for best performance
- All TypeScript types are properly defined
- No linter errors present
- Camera permissions are properly configured for both iOS and Android
